# Applied-Econimetrics
- these files are ordered 1-25. they contain 6 problem sets that deal with different data sets and econimetric problems. Each problem set consists of a write up, do file, log file, and dataset file. 

- I explore and experiment with different types of methods from basic statistical methods like t-stats, chi-squares, and simple OLS to complex models like regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, fixed effects, random effects, robust,and cluster models.
